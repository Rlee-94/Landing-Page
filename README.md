# Landing-Page

This is my second project from TOP. I am creating a simple landing page that will showcase the use of HTMl,CSS, using flex, borders, padding, and margin.
It will also showcase the ability to use git commits to push changes to my portoflio.

 I plan to come back and implement javascript when I have more experience.
